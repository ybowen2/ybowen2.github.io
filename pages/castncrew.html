	Name: Alicia Powers<br>
	Graduation Year: 2015<br>
	Major(s) and Minor(s): UCSD Alumn<br>
	Position: Director<br>

	<p>When describing the personality of Alicia, the easiest point of reference is the character "Joy" from the popular film, Inside Out. Alicia is a positive, vibrant, and bubbly, ball-of-energy who just wants to spread love and happiness to the world! Alicia feels most alive when she is salsa dancing (or any kind of dancing really), practicing yoga, or crafting. And yes, she is that girl who loves dogs and long walks on the beach. 
	</p>
	<p>Since graduating, Alicia has whole-heartedly chosen to stay in sunny San Diego because, to her, this vibrant city by the ocean feels like her true home. She now works full time (sometimes nights and weekends), but is so passionate about her work she doesn't care! For Alicia, working to develop student's potential never feels like a job. She always seeks to find a balance between time for herself and giving to others because to Alicia, self care is the MOST important! smile emoticon
	</p>
	<p>Alicia is deeply honored to have been chosen to co-direct the show this year. She is enthusiastically motivated to do the "dirty work" behind the scenes, to create a space for these women to see their own strength that she, as a director, has seen all along. Alicia says she would never be able to truly find the right words to describe the importance of The Vagina Monologues in her own life or for the world.</p>
	<p>However, a quote from her favorite feminist sums up her feelings about this show quite well: "By doing the work to love ourselves more, I believe we will love each other better." -Laverne Cox</p>

	<p>She hopes you all enjoy watching the show just as she much as she has enjoyed directing it! Let's go girls!</p>

		<p>Name: Arielsela H-Smith<br>
		Graduation Year: 2017<br>
		Major(s) and Minor(s): Global Health<br>
		Position: Director <br>
	</p>
	<p>	Arielsela is a (relatively) carefree Black girl who has a special cabinet in her home solely filled with tea ready to sip. On paper, she will be receiving a degree in Global Health, but don't come at her though cus she may very well be graduating at the top of her class with a double major in Petty with a specialization in Commentary from the Sidelines because Bey told her best revenge is your paper. In general, her face speaks more than her mouth does. Catch her frequently lookin back at it during her tours tryin not to fall, spending time with the folk of the many multicultural organizations she's in, or getting lost in the sauce of the Global Health department. She trusts in the power of laughter, love, and lotion (the only L's she'll ever take), but also in marginalized communities, good food with good company, the arts, her melanin, and herself. Arielsela firmly believes in measuring life in meals and music. Example: Approximately, how many replays of Mama Badu's "Hello" will take you from UCSD to Ralph's?? These are truly the questions you need to be asking in order to properly flourish as you bless up! </p>

	<p>Why did she return this year as a director this year, you ask? Well, being in cast for last year's production made her realize how necessary, powerful, and beautiful her voice is/can be, particularly on a campus where her story/background is underrepresented and often unrecognized. She noticed too that there was a need for a wider set of stories to be heard through the process of this production. And because she believes that that change and redirection could start with her, with these womxn, with THIS community of VagMo. Because we can do better.</p>
		
	<p>Arielsela is mad hype to engage this community because she is very much here for the empowerment of a diverse set of young womxn, and helping to bring them to the point where they can revolutionize the traditionally Eurocentric, cisnormative, heteronormative, ableist (etc.) social dialogues without fear. She feels that if every individual can walk away from this experience recognizing the power of their voice as well as the power of LISTENING, that her job is done. She is honored to be on this journey with the cast and crew members and her very supportive co-directors, and to be able to see each of them smile a little bigger, walk a little prouder, and own their complete being.</p>

		<p>Name: Armenuhi Avanesyan<br>
Graduation Year: 2016<br>
Major(s) and Minor(s): Microbiology and with a minor in Psychology<br> 
Position: Director<br> 
</p>
<p>Armenuhi is almost done with her undergraduate years. You can find her walking, quickly (with an occasional fruit in one hand and coffee in the other) from one class to another. If she sees you she will beam at you and yell out your name in case you don't see her, and then she'll give you a hug (the coffee and fruit are still in her hands). 
</p>
<p>In her spare time, Armenuhi likes to read lots of books, at the same time! (but mostly she rereads Jane Austen, even the unfinished one). She also loves to write bad(ass) poetry and blog. She loves to play sports and will definitely break a toe for her team! Her not so secret talents include professional eyebrow doing and dancing.
</p>
<p>She finds teaching absolutely amazing and has been a math tutor, a biology TA, and English teacher/ tutor throughout her undergraduate years. She speaks Armenian and Russian, and some Spanish. She is pursuing research in immunology along with obtaining a bioinformatics certificate. 
</p>
<p>She has a dog named Leo who looks like a hairy old grandfather and a wonderful sister and mom who look "just like her!" according to random strangers. She loves her family, lab group, friends, and the Vagina Monologues warriors very much and is inspired by them everyday! 
</p>
<p>Armenuhi was cast in the Vagina Monologues last year, in the monologue "Hair," and was inspired by past years' directors to do all that she could for future generations of vagina warriors. She will never stop fighting for women's rights/gender equality/feminism. She wants to start a nonprofit organization for victims of domestic violence in Armenia and believes that education is most important when it comes to empowering and improving the conditions of women globally and has dedicated the rest of her life to doing just that.

		Name: Taylor Fulmore<br>
Graduation Year: 2016<br>
Major(s) and Minor(s): Communication with a minor in African American Studies<br>
Position: Cast<br>
<p>
Taylor is a fourth year/transfer student from Vallejo, CA. (Yay Areeeaaa!) She spent her first two years of college at UC Merced before making the trip down to Sunny San Diego to pursue a degree in Communication. Aside from school work, Taylor is a Resident Assistant for Sixth College, a cashier at the Parking Office, a lipstick enthusiast, an ardent believer in the zodiac and Baduism, and just an overall melanin-filled joy to be around.
</p><p>
If you would ever like to hang out/have lunch with Taylor, don't be shy. She's friendly, funny, and fluent in Pettiness and Shade. Don't be fooled: they don't want you to have radical and radiant friends like Taylor...but trust me, knowing her is a MAJOR KEY.#BlessUp 
</p><p>
Taylor is thrilled to be apart of the Vagina Monologues, as it's been a part of her college bucket list since her first year. Taylor hopes that her presence in VagMo is impactful and inspirational to womxn of color, like herself, especially, because they often are left out of conversations regarding sexuality, violence, beauty, love, etc. Taylor hopes that everyone coming to see the show takes something from it--whether it be a well-needed laugh, an even more needed cry, or simply just a better understanding of what it's like to navigate this world under the classification of 'Womxn.'

	Name: Uma Mahto<br>
Graduation Year: 2018<br>
Major(s) and Minor(s): Bioengineering - Bioinformatics with a minor in Cognitive Science<br>
Position: Cast<br>
<p>
Uma is from the lovely town of Santa Clara, California but she's also from the thriving city of Bangalore! Prior to attending UC San Diego, she lived in Bangalore, India for 6 years and considers it to be one the best experiences in her life. She loves dogs (once a puppy always a puppy), her family, friends, Muir, reading, baking, samosas, and meeting new people!
</p><p>
The Vagina Monologues mean a lot to Uma because she has two younger sisters and comes from a family where women are now being encouraged to grow and conquer the world. Living in India where the perception of women and the mentality toward women is still undergoing change, she knows how dangerous it can be to sit idle and not speak up. The Vagina Monologues sparks discussion, debate, and brings people from diverse and varying perspectives to talk about more than just the female body and then build change!</p><p>

Apart from the Vagina Monologues, Uma is also the International and Out of State Rep for Muir College Council (MCC) and the Outreach Internal for the Triton Engineering Student Council (TESC). She is also a part of the amazing Global TIES Viral Load project team this quarter. This summer she will working for Girls Who Code, a nonprofit organization working to close the gender gap in the technology and engineering sectors. She hopes she will continue to become more involved in Muir and around the campus through clubs, committees, and leadership positions and involve everyone who's interested in what she does!
</p><p>
She is excited to be a part of this amazing group of women and hopefully inspire change in the thoughts and discussions about vaginas and the struggles many young girls undergo. Uma hopes she will be able to reach out to her friends and family in areas where women have yet to rise and bring light to several issues.

	Graduation Year: 2016<br>
	Major(s) and minor(s): Communications with a minor in Education Studies<br>
	Position: Pussy Posse<br>
	<p>
	Kat is proud Vagina Warrior who is honored to be a part of such an important feminist movement. As a major theater enthusiast and former Drama nerd, she had heard a lot about the Vagina Monologues but had never given it much thought. Until she went to see a friend perform in last year’s production. She was sold. Honestly, she was slightly uncomfortable watching the show at first but once she stopped thinking about other people’s opinions of her, she threw caution to the wind and realized just how vital this play is. It was incredibly liberating to hear that the thoughts she has had for so many years were finally being said aloud. That production of Vagina Monologues changed her life in so many ways that she knew she had to be a part of it this year. 
	</p><p>
	Being able to share this experience with so many wonderfully inspiring and empowering woman is a true blessing, and she is immensely grateful. She hopes that her involvement in Vagina Monologues will inspire her friends, family, and random Facebook friends to think deeply about the state of feminism, sexual assault, sexuality, and gender norms in our society. She encourages the people who are curious about these issues to come see our show or a Vagina Monologues production at a theater near you!

	Name: Xiomara Linares<br>
Graduation Year: 2018<br>
Major(s) and Minor(s): Economics - Mathematics with a minor in Accounting<br> 
Position: Pussy Posse<br>

<p>Xiomara loves going outdoors, mainly to the beach or hiking. Her favorite hike was to Potato Chip Rock because of the beautiful view from the top. Although she has a thirst for outdoor activities, she is still a shy person when first meeting someone, but after becoming acquainted with you she is a ball of fun. She also really loves softball, arts and crafts, and watching The Office and Friends on Netflix. She knows Friends so well that if it is running in the background, she could re-enact what is going on in the show.
</p><p>
Xiomara is a Vagina Warrior because she wants to become more self-empowered. She wants to become more confident not only as woman but as a human being as well. Knowing the inequality in the work force, she wants to use her confidence to not get discouraged quickly. In addition, Xiomara wants to help other women feel comfortable with themselves. A lot of women suffer from a lack of confidence that stop them from accomplishing things that they want. She wants to help women tear down this mental barrier.</p>

			Name: Eden Soni Bhalla<br>
	Graduation Year: 2017<br>
	Major(s) and Minor(s): Sociology (with an emphasis in Culture and Communication) and a minor in Art History<br> 
	Position: Cast<br>

	<p>Soni is a free spirited junior at UCSD who enjoys hiking, going to the nude beach at Black's, and wandering around museums. Soni goes by her middle name, and hails from Houston, Texas. She does not have an accent, though she does have a horse (she rides English, not Western). Soni is a Sociology major because she believes that being educated on social issues on a global scale is an incredibly powerful thing. She hopes to study abroad in Morocco next fall, and utilize the sociological skills she's learned in pursuing research on feminist movements within Islam. Soni is also learning Arabic, and hopes to expand her knowledge of the language while she's there. 
	Soni loves music; she plays guitar, and she sings sometimes. She also knows all the words to every song in Phantom of the Opera. Soni also loves coffee, and thinks she might be addicted. She loves to spend her evenings listening to records and reading T.S. Eliot while cuddling with her cat, Nina Simone. 
	</p><p>
	When she saw the Vagina Monologues for the first time during her freshman year at UCSD, Soni knew that she had to be a part of such a powerful demonstration of unapologetic feminist spunk. One of the most striking aspects of the Vagina Monologues to Soni, was that it brought so many marginalized lives and voices into the spotlight; the voices of old womxn, young womxn, girls, womxn of wide and varied ethnic backgrounds, womxn who are survivors, to only name a few. Soni feels extremely grateful to be a part of such a powerful and transformative production, and to have the experience of being surrounded by so many incredible, powerful womxn in the VagMo community. Soni believes that the Vagina Monologues can be life changing, and urges you to come watch the production and experience the education, hope, fun, and empowerment that VagMo gave to her.
